My name is Paulo Pompeu (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working as Software Engineer since ... for a while ðŸ˜†

I'm and currently working on a plataform to help ppl to build software with #NoCode. And it's amazing! 

### Only 0.3% of people...
know how to code today. This means that 99.7% of people donâ€™t have the ability to create software or solve their own problems with code. The goal of the â€˜no-codeâ€™ movement is to give more people an entry-point into software & empower a new wave of makers.
